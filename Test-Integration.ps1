.SYNOPSIS
    Runs integration tests for the Traefik Geoblock Plugin

.DESCRIPTION
    This script starts the Docker Compose services, waits for them to be ready,
    runs the Pester integration tests, and then cleans up the services.

.PARAMETER SkipDockerCleanup
    Skip stopping Docker services after tests complete (useful for debugging)

.PARAMETER SkipWait
    Skip waiting for services to be ready (assumes they're already running)

.PARAMETER TestPath
    Path to the Pester test file (defaults to ./scripts/integration-tests.Tests.ps1)

.EXAMPLE
    ./Test-Integration.ps1
    Runs the full integration test suite

.EXAMPLE
    ./Test-Integration.ps1 -SkipDockerCleanup
    Runs tests but leaves Docker services running for debugging

.EXAMPLE
    ./Test-Integration.ps1 -SkipWait
    Runs tests assuming services are already running
